### Building the Robot Base  

Last week, we began the process of assembling the base of our robot, focusing on the essential connection between the motor and the wheel. This step is crucial because the motor-to-wheel setup forms the core of the robot’s movement system, allowing it to translate motor rotation into forward or backward motion. I found this part of the build both challenging and informative, as it gave me a deeper understanding of how mechanical components come together to enable movement.

Our task began by extending the motor's wiring. The original wires attached to the motor were too short, so we needed to solder additional wires to ensure they would reach the power source and control system once installed on the robot. This step was essential for making sure the motor would function correctly in the robot's final assembly.

After finishing the soldering, I moved on to screwing a metal bracket onto the motor. This bracket is designed to hold the motor securely to the robot’s wooden frame, ensuring that it stays stable during operation. Properly securing the motor is important because any instability or looseness could cause the motor to misalign or the wheel to wobble, which would impact the robot's movement. This part of the process required precision, as we had to align the bracket perfectly with the motor and frame to ensure everything would fit together snugly.

Unfortunately, I had to leave class early and wasn’t able to finish attaching the motor to the wheel. The next steps would have involved mounting the motor assembly to the robot’s base and securing the wheel onto the motor shaft. Even though I didn’t get to complete the task, I’m looking forward to finishing it in the next session and seeing the base fully assembled and ready for the next stages of the robot’s build.
