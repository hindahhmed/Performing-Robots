### Building the Robot Base  

Last week, we began the process of assembling the base of our robot, focusing on the essential connection between the motor and the wheel. This step is crucial because the motor-to-wheel setup forms the core of the robot’s movement system, allowing it to translate motor rotation into forward or backward motion. I found this part of the build both challenging and informative, as it gave me a deeper understanding of how mechanical components come together to enable movement.

Our task began by extending the motor's wiring. The original wires attached to the motor were too short, so we needed to solder additional wires to ensure they would reach the power source and control system once installed on the robot. This step was essential for making sure the motor would function correctly in the robot's final assembly.

After finishing the soldering, I moved on to screwing a metal bracket onto the motor. This bracket is designed to hold the motor securely to the robot’s wooden frame, ensuring that it stays stable during operation. Properly securing the motor is important because any instability or looseness could cause the motor to misalign or the wheel to wobble, which would impact the robot's movement. This part of the process required precision, as we had to align the bracket perfectly with the motor and frame to ensure everything would fit together snugly.

Unfortunately, I had to leave class early and wasn’t able to finish attaching the motor to the wheel. The next steps would have involved mounting the motor assembly to the robot’s base and securing the wheel onto the motor shaft. Even though I didn’t get to complete the task, I’m looking forward to finishing it in the next session and seeing the base fully assembled and ready for the next stages of the robot’s build.

### Continuing the Robot Base

Last week, we made significant progress in constructing the base of our robot by successfully attaching the four wheels to the wooden platform. Since we were slightly behind schedule the previous week, we pushed ourselves to catch up and stay on track with our project timeline.

We began by carefully measuring the exact placement for each wheel and drilling precise holes into the wood to secure the bolts. With the measurements in place, we attached the two motors and the larger wheels to the wooden base. However, we encountered a challenge when trying to fit the two smaller wheels on the opposite side. To ensure the smaller wheels were aligned with the larger ones, we needed to find pieces of wood that would provide the necessary height, allowing the board to have a slight wobble, which would help the robot maneuver more easily once completed.

This task proved tricky as we struggled to figure out how to secure the smaller pieces of wood without damaging them during the drilling process. Fortunately, Professor Shiloh stepped in and provided a lot of guidance on how to position the nails properly to avoid any damage. With his help, we were able to drill adjacent nails and successfully attach the wood, creating a solid foundation for the smaller wheels.

Once the wheels were in place, we moved on to securing the battery. We drilled four holes near the center of the board and used zip ties to attach the battery as close to the center as possible. This placement was critical to maintaining the balance of the robot, given the weight of the battery. Despite the challenges, our efforts paid off, and we’re now in a strong position to continue with the next steps of the build.

### Presentation Questions
Linh Presentation Question: 

In Sayonara Geminoid F, the robot plays a central role in conveying emotions, which is typically a very human trait. Do you think performances like this challenge or enhance our understanding of what it means to be human, especially in terms of expressing grief and emotional vulnerability through a machine?


Toomie Presentation Question:

Hiroshi Ishiguro’s Geminoid HI-1 was designed to closely mimic human behavior and appearance, but how do you think the ability to replicate subtle human traits, like micro-expressions or body language, impacts our emotional connection or discomfort with robots? Could this technology blur the lines between humans and machines in ways we aren’t fully prepared for?
